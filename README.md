# Sorting-Algorithms-Visualizer
As the name suggests, It's a sorting algorithms visualization tool which is not new idea but I needed to create some react app that related to algorithms.

I guess it can be used as a great educational tool as it shows every step of the involved sorting algorithms, and has multiple options that makes it easier to know more about algorithms and compre between them.

### The supported algorithms:
  - Bubble sort.
  - Selection sort.
  - insertion sort.
  - Merge sort.
  - Quick Sort.
  - Heap sort.
