# Sorting-Algorithms-Visualizer
As the name suggests, It's a sorting algorithms visualization tool which is not new idea but I needed to create some react app that related to algorithms.
It can be used as a great educational tool as it shows every step of the involved sorting algorithms, and has multiple options that makes it easier to know more about algorithms and compre between them.
You can access the app here: mohamedmahmoudhassan.github.io/Sorting-Algorithms-Visualizer/
